            "To calculate the intrinsic value of AAPL using the owner earnings method, we first need to understand what owner earnings are. Owner earnings, a concept popularized by Warren Buffett, represent the cash flows available to shareholders after accounting for the necessary investments in the business to maintain its competitive position and unit volume. This approach focuses on the true economic profits of the company, providing a clearer picture of its financial health and potential for generating returns for shareholders.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Net Income**: For the fiscal year 2022, AAPL reported a net income of approximately $94.68 billion.\n",
            "2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: The total depreciation and amortization for AAPL in 2022 was about $12.18 billion.\n",
            "3. **Capital Expenditures**: AAPL's capital expenditures for 2022 were roughly $13.53 billion.\n",
            "4. **Change in Working Capital**: The change in working capital for AAPL in 2022 was a decrease of about $11.88 billion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plugging these numbers into the formula:\n",
            "Owner Earnings = $94.68 billion + $12.18 billion - $13.53 billion - $11.88 billion\n",

            "Owner Earnings = $81.45 billion\n",
            "\n",
            "To find the intrinsic value of AAPL based on owner earnings, we can use a multiple that reflects the market's expectation of future growth and profitability. A common approach is to use a price-to-owner earnings (P/OE) ratio. Assuming a P/OE ratio of 20 (which is a general assumption and may vary based on market conditions and the specific industry), we can estimate the intrinsic value of AAPL as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "Intrinsic Value = Owner Earnings * P/OE Ratio\n",
            "Intrinsic Value = $81.45 billion * 20\n",
            "Intrinsic Value = $1,628.9 billion\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the total number of outstanding shares of AAPL as of 2022 is approximately 16.45 billion, the intrinsic value per share can be calculated as:\n",
            "Intrinsic Value Per Share = $1,628.9 billion / 16.45 billion shares\n",
            "Intrinsic Value Per Share = $99.00\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, based on the owner earnings method and the assumptions made, the intrinsic value of AAPL per share is approximately $99.00. This valuation provides a snapshot of the company's intrinsic value at a particular point in time, based on its ability to generate cash flows available to shareholders. It is essential to note that this is a simplified calculation and actual valuations may require more detailed analysis, including considerations of growth prospects, industry position, and other qualitative factors.\u001b[00m\n",

            "The intrinsic value of AAPL using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, specifically the owner earnings approach, is estimated to be approximately $1,628.9 billion. This valuation is based on the company's ability to generate cash flows available to shareholders, as represented by its owner earnings, which were calculated to be $81.45 billion for the fiscal year 2022. By applying a price-to-owner earnings (P/OE) ratio of 20, the intrinsic value of AAPL is estimated to be $1,628.9 billion. On a per-share basis, the intrinsic value is approximately $99.00, given the total number of outstanding shares of AAPL as of 2022 is approximately 16.45 billion. This valuation provides a snapshot of the company's intrinsic value at a particular point in time and is based on the assumptions made, including the use of a P/OE ratio of 20. The owner earnings calculation takes into account the company's net income, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and change in working capital, providing a clearer picture of its financial health and potential for generating returns for shareholders. The intrinsic value per share of $99.00 represents the estimated value of each share of AAPL based on its ability to generate cash flows available to shareholders, and it is essential to note that this is a simplified calculation and actual valuations may require more detailed analysis, including considerations of growth prospects, industry position, and other qualitative factors.\u001b[00m\n",

The company's business model revolves around premium products such as iPhones, Macs, and services like Apple Music and iCloud, targeting tech-savvy consumers and businesses worldwide.\n",

            "The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis yielded a slightly higher intrinsic value of around $105 per share. This method accounts for the time value of money and future cash flow projections, underscoring Apple's sustainable growth and competitive edge in the tech industry.\n",
