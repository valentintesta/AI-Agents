# 🥤 Investment Analysis: The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

## 1. 🧠 Understanding the Business (Circle of Competence)

Coca-Cola is a business that’s easy to understand. It produces and distributes non-alcoholic beverages, primarily soft drinks, but also water, juices, teas, coffee, and energy drinks. Its main product (classic Coca-Cola) has over 130 years of history and global recognition.

- Stable and predictable business model.  
- Global operations with proven distribution channels.  
- Not dependent on fast technological changes or sudden disruptions.

✅ *Well within my circle of competence.*

## 3. 🧮 Intrinsic Value and Margin of Safety

I use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate intrinsic value. Coca-Cola consistently generates free cash flow and has high visibility into its future revenues.

- Moderate growth assumption: 4-6% annually.  
- Conservative discount rate: ~8-9%.

📉 *If the market price is at least 20–30% below intrinsic value, that provides a sufficient margin of safety.*

✅ *Only invest when there's a clear margin.*

## 4. 🏰 Competitive Advantage (Economic Moat)

Coca-Cola has one of the **strongest moats in the world**:

- **Globally recognized brand** in nearly every country.  
- **Exclusive relationships** with distributors and retailers.  
- **Unmatchable economies of scale**.  
- **High customer loyalty**: consumers have a strong brand preference.  

Example: Many people say "I'll have a Coke" even if they want a different drink.

✅ *A deep, durable moat.*

## 5. 🕰️ Time Horizon

My approach: **“Buy and hold.”** Coca-Cola is a stock I would consider holding **forever**.

- Decades-long track record of rising dividends.  
- Resilient business even in economic downturns.  
- Ability to adapt without losing its essence.

✅ *Perfect for long-term investing.*
