## üåü Project Overview

An AI-powered investment analysis tool that leverages investment portfolio agent that provide comprehensive portfolio insights. This intelligent agent helps investors make data-driven decisions by offering deep portfolio risk assessment, stock profiling, and personalized recommendations.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Features
- **Stock Risk Profiling**: Detailed risk assessment for individual stocks, including volatility, market cap, and return potential.
- **Portfolio Diversification Analysis**: Breakdown of sector allocation and risk levels within a given portfolio. 
- **Expected Return Calculation**: Estimation of annual returns based on historical stock performance.
- **Intelligent Portfolio Adjustments**: Personalized recommendations aligned with user's risk tolerance.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for easy interaction with the AI agent.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ How Crew AI- Agent works

The Investment Portfolio Analysis AI Agent is built on the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework, which combines the strength of large language models with a structured approach to problem-solving. Here's the workflow:

1. **Thought**: The agent analyzes the user's query and formulates a plan of action.
2. **Action**: Based on the thought, the agent selects and executes an appropriate tool or API call.
3. **Observation**: The agent observes and interprets the results of the action.
4. **Repeat**: This cycle continues until the agent has gathered enough information to provide a comprehensive answer.

### Extension to Tool Calling

The framework can be extended to incorporate specialized tools:

- **Tool Definition**: Each tool (e.g., stock risk profiler, portfolio analyzer) is defined with clear inputs and outputs.
- **Tool Selection**: The agent learns to choose the most appropriate tool based on the current context and user query.
- **Tool Execution**: The selected tool is called with the necessary parameters.
- **Result Integration**: The agent incorporates tool outputs into its reasoning process for the final response.

This extension allows the agent to leverage specific financial analysis functions while maintaining a flexible, language-model-driven interaction flow.
