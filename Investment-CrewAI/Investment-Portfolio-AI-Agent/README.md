## 🌟 Project Overview

An AI-powered investment analysis tool that leverages investment portfolio agent that provide comprehensive portfolio insights. This intelligent agent helps investors make data-driven decisions by offering deep portfolio risk assessment, stock profiling, and personalized recommendations.

## 🏗️ Key Features
- **Stock Risk Profiling**: Detailed risk assessment for individual stocks, including volatility, market cap, and return potential.
- **Portfolio Diversification Analysis**: Breakdown of sector allocation and risk levels within a given portfolio. 
- **Expected Return Calculation**: Estimation of annual returns based on historical stock performance.
- **Intelligent Portfolio Adjustments**: Personalized recommendations aligned with user's risk tolerance.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for easy interaction with the AI agent.

## 👨‍🏫 How Crew AI- Agent works

The Investment Portfolio Analysis AI Agent is built on the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework, which combines the strength of large language models with a structured approach to problem-solving. Here's the workflow:

1. **Thought**: The agent analyzes the user's query and formulates a plan of action.
2. **Action**: Based on the thought, the agent selects and executes an appropriate tool or API call.
3. **Observation**: The agent observes and interprets the results of the action.
4. **Repeat**: This cycle continues until the agent has gathered enough information to provide a comprehensive answer.

### Extension to Tool Calling

The framework can be extended to incorporate specialized tools:

- **Tool Definition**: Each tool (e.g., stock risk profiler, portfolio analyzer) is defined with clear inputs and outputs.
- **Tool Selection**: The agent learns to choose the most appropriate tool based on the current context and user query.
- **Tool Execution**: The selected tool is called with the necessary parameters.
- **Result Integration**: The agent incorporates tool outputs into its reasoning process for the final response.

This extension allows the agent to leverage specific financial analysis functions while maintaining a flexible, language-model-driven interaction flow.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python
- **AI Model**: Groq API

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Groq API Key

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/investment-portfolio-ai.git
cd investment-portfolio-ai
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables
- Create a `.env` file
- Add your Groq API key: `GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key`
- Optionally you can add file paths to stock risk json file and system prompt

`STOCK_DATA_PATH=your_stock_data_json_file_path`
`SYS_PROMPT_DATA_PATH=your_system_prompt_data_path`

## 🖥️ Usage

### Streamlit Web Application
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Example Queries
